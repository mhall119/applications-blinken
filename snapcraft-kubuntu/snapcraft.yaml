version: 16.04.1

summary: A memory enhancement game


description: "<p>Blinken is based on an electronic game released in 1978, which challenges
  players to remember sequences of increasing length. On the face of the device, there
  are 4 different color buttons, each one with their own distinctive sound. These
  buttons light up randomly, creating the sequence that the player must then recall.
  If the player is successful in remembering the sequence of lights in the correct
  order, they advance to the next stage, where an identical sequence with one extra
  step is presented. If they are incorrect, the game is lost, and the player must
  start again from the beginning. The goal is to get a high score - each step in the
  sequence is worth one point, so correct entry of a sequence of 8 lights is worth
  8 points on the high score table.</p>"
